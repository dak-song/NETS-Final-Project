Aggregation Module -- The Start of an Idea (1 point)
In this component, we act as writers who want to create a new story with the help of crowdworkers. We will start off the story by offering a paragraph that will help future workers continue the storyline. 

Aggregation Module -- The Making of a Story with corresponding Quality Control (10 points -- 1 for each page)
We have ten workers write the next page of the story given the topic. Each page will be 2 sentences to a paragraph. Then we have 30 workers do a rating task (3 for each submission) described above. We then have another 10 workers write the following page, and another 30 workers to evaluate their submissions. Note that this second rating task will have the text from the all the previously selected pages, because they need to be evaluating the whole story. This process repeats until we have reached the desired limit, in which case we will give the instruction to the workers to conclude the story. 

Illustration Module with corresponding Quality Control (5 points)
We take the finished text and put it on a design/illustration crowdsourcing platform, and specify that we want an illustration for every one or two pages plus a cover and end illustration.
