The aggregation-code file gives the HTML for the Crowdflower HIIT where workers have to enter a minimum and maximum length of characters.
The quality-control-pseudocode works by majority vote where we aggregate the ratings of all the workers for a certain story and average them,
and pick the highest rated story.
The aggregation.R file contains our aggregation model, so it contains the code to pick the best sentence in each iteration.
