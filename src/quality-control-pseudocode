For the quality control module, we will implement a 2nd pass HIT, and then use majority vote to decide 
which paragraph was most highly rated. Below is the code to identify the most highly rated paragraph.

For each worker "wid" {
  int max = 0;
  int paragraph = 0;
  for each unique input paragraph "pid" {
    rating = worker_relevance + worker_interesting + worker_humorous + worker_appropriate + worker_thoughtfulness
    if (rating > max) {
      max = rating;
      paragraph = pid
    }
  }
  make a new table "finaltable" with entry (wid, paragraph);  //(wid, paragraph) represents the paragraph that the worker liked the most
}

In the table "finaltable", pick the paragraph according to majority vote across all workers.
